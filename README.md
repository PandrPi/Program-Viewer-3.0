# Program-Viewer-3.0

This project I created for learning WPF. This is a third version of Program Viewer, last version of which I developed around 2017-2018.
The main idea of these projects is to keep a desktop free from not very frequently used folders and files( items in one word). 
I realised that I need to occupy some desktop's space to provide the opportunity for users of using most important items without
wasting the time. So Interface is divided into two sections: "hot" and "desktop". Desktop section can be opened when needed and is
designed for containing not very frequently used items. Hot section is used to contain the most frequently used items(preffered exe), 
it is always visible ( if not overlayed by another programs ).
